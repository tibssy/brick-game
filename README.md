# Brick Game

Welcome to the Brick Game project! This isn't just a traditional Tetris game; it's a multifaceted arcade experience that combines several classic games into one. In addition to the traditional Tetris gameplay, this game includes a nostalgic snake game and a variant of Tetris with additional brick types and special features.

The Tetris mode features the classic falling block gameplay where you aim to clear lines by arranging falling bricks. The Snake mode offers a nostalgic experience where you guide a snake to collect items and grow longer while avoiding collisions. The Tetris Extra mode introduces new brick types and special features, adding layers of strategy and challenge.
